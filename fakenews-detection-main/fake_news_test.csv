"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  No one ever truly gets over losing a loved one, and Blake Shelton is no exception. He was just 14 when his older brother Richie died on Nov. 13, 1990. And, as Shelton noted in a tweet Monday, ""It changed my life forever.""  Richie was 24 when he died in a car accident in the Sheltons' home state of Oklahoma. Two years ago, Shelton sent out a message for the 25th anniversary of his loss:  Richie, who was Blake's half-brother (they shared a mother), was a passenger in a car that collided with a school bus in Ada, south of Oklahoma City.  Richie, driver Redena McManus and a 3-year-old boy, Christopher McManus, all died during or shortly after the collision, while the bus driver and passengers were uninjured, according to police reports.  The accident has clearly remained with Blake, who told 60 Minutes in 2014, ""I remember picking up the phone to call him a week after he was dead, to tell him something. I was picking up the phone to call him, to tell him something I just saw on TV or, and it was like constantly a shock to me that he was dead.""  Blake Shelton playing at TODAY's Halloween Extravaganza in New York City on Oct. 31. Getty Images  In 2011, Blake and his then-wife Miranda Lambert wrote a single called ""Over You,"" which was inspired by Richie.  Still, the two brothers had bonded despite the age difference; both shared a love of country music. ""His bedroom was right across the hallway from mine when I was little,"" Blake said in that interview. ""And he was listening to Hank Williams, Jr. or Waylon, Lynyrd Skynyrd or Bob Seeger. I just, whatever was popular really, Richie loved all music.  ""And I would be sitting there going, 'Man, that guy's my hero. That's the coolest guy. Heâ€™s my big brother.'""

"Much like a certain Amazon goddess with a lasso, there are no heights that director Patty Jenkins canâ€™t scale. Her blockbuster â€œWonder Woman,â€ which has grossed a staggering $821 million worldwide since it opened in the summer, has become a rallying call for women everywhere and a beacon of empowerment in a Donald Trump-led world. Beyond all the Instagram posts of little girls decked out in â€œWWâ€ regalia while seeing the film and an endorsement from Hillary Clinton, Jenkins recently cracked another glass ceiling. Sheâ€™ll be directing â€œWonder Woman 2â€ for a reported $7 million to $9 million, a record salary for a female filmmaker.  As she negotiated the terms of her contract with Warner Bros. over several months, Jenkins was conscious of what earning a big paycheck would mean. â€œYouâ€™re of course aware of the money,â€ says Jenkins on a sunny afternoon in Los Angeles. â€œBut Iâ€™ve never been more aware of a duty than I was in this deal. I was extremely aware that I had to make sure I was being paid what the male equivalent would be.â€  CREDIT: Art Streiber for Variety  According to recent studies, women only earn roughly 80 cents to every dollar that men get. The pay gap is evident in all corners of society, even Hollywood, where A-list actresses such as Jennifer Lawrence and Charlize Theron have had to fight to be compensated the same as their male peers. But until now, thereâ€™s never been an A-list female director with as much clout as Jenkins. Other women behind big live-action tentpoles, such as Catherine Hardwicke (â€œTwilightâ€) and Sam Taylor-Johnson (â€œFifty Shades of Greyâ€), didnâ€™t return for second installments, and the studios quickly replaced them with male directors.  â€œWomen who have not been in a system that allows them to build up the same level of pay as men are not able to be paid the same as men forever if thatâ€™s the way it continues,â€ Jenkins says. â€œYou have to ask for it to happen, and you have to ask when youâ€™re the appropriate person.â€ She points to Theron, who starred in her 2003 independent film â€œMonsterâ€ and won an Oscar for the role. â€œI knew when Charlize had to do it on â€˜Snow White and the Huntsman,â€™ and I felt that it was my job to do it here.â€  Gal Gadot, the star of â€œWonder Woman,â€ was cheering Jenkins on. â€œShe is definitely paving the way for so many other female directors,â€ Gadot says. â€œI think it was very important that she fought to get the best deal. You got to walk the walk and talk the talk.â€  Despite the results of the presidential election and womenâ€™s marches throughout the country, Jenkins never imagined that â€œWonder Womanâ€ would touch such a nerve. â€œI didnâ€™t really start to make the connection about the lightning rod it was going to hit until it had opened,â€ says Jenkins, who gets stopped by strangers who profess how much the movie has meant to them. â€œI assumed that it would be seen just as a superhero film.â€ Sheâ€™s in awe of all the high-profile groupies that sheâ€™s collected along the way. â€œWhen you hear about people like Hillary Clinton or Dwayne Johnson talking about you in the press, itâ€™s like, â€˜What!â€™ Itâ€™s so crazy and lovely.â€  Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot share a moment on the set of â€œWonder Woman.â€  Courtesy of Warner Bros/Clay Enos  As Wonder Woman has resurfaced as a cultural icon, Jenkins has been the brains behind the movement. â€œIâ€™ve become more well-known than I ever thought I would,â€ Jenkins says. â€œI didnâ€™t think I would be getting this much attention.â€ Acting as an ambassador for the disenfranchised is a responsibility that Jenkins doesnâ€™t take lightly. â€œI think the legacy of â€˜Wonder Womanâ€™ is a different kind of hero, one that hits the same marks but also really is about love and empowerment in a slightly different way,â€ she says. â€œI think thatâ€™s why I love that people wear her outfit. People who are struggling in some sort of way or donâ€™t identify with the world they live in can often find themselves in Wonder Woman.â€  Although some critics have read â€œWonder Womanâ€ as a feminist manifesto â€” when our hero meets her love interest, Steve (Chris Pine), she keeps her clothes on, while heâ€™s naked â€” Jenkins didnâ€™t think about it in those terms. â€œNot at all,â€ she says. â€œAnd that is the success of feminism. I have always wanted to be last-wave feminism, where youâ€™re so feminist, youâ€™re not thinking about it at all. Where youâ€™re like, â€˜Of course this superhero is the greatest superhero of all time. Oh, sheâ€™s a woman? I wasnâ€™t even thinking about that!â€™â€  Not everybody has been a fan of â€œWonder Woman.â€ After James Cameron publicly bashed the movie with a misogynistic shrug, Jenkins shot back with her own statement on social media. â€œI actually was not upset at all,â€ Jenkins says. â€œEverybody is entitled to their own opinion. But if youâ€™re going to debate something in a public way, I have to reply that I think itâ€™s incorrect.â€ Did Cameron ever reach out to apologize? â€œNo,â€ she says.  Jenkins worked in Hollywood as a focus puller and a camera operator in her 20s. She was among the small group of women doing a manâ€™s job, but she wasnâ€™t so aware of it. â€œI never thought about the fact that I was the only woman,â€ she says. Even so, she thinks itâ€™s important to mentor other women as they try to climb the industry ladder. â€œI definitely do,â€ says Jenkins. â€œBut also, I feel a real obligation to be open to help everyone. I really think that â€˜Wonder Womanâ€™ is a loving character to all.â€  Thereâ€™s been a lot of talk about why 14 years elapsed between her first film and â€œWonder Woman.â€ Jenkins says that it was mostly her decision, because she wanted to be at home at night with her son and her husband. And itâ€™s not as if she wasnâ€™t working. She took on TV projects like directing the pilot of â€œThe Killing.â€ â€œWhen you have a little baby, directing a feature where youâ€™re gone every few years is not the easiest thing to sync up,â€ Jenkins says. â€œI know people who have done it. It wasnâ€™t something I chose to do.â€  I have always wanted to be last-wave feminism, where youâ€™re so feminist, youâ€™re not thinking about it at all.â€  PATTY JENKINS  All the speculation about her career is understandable. The industry still has a dismal record when hiring women directors in the movies: Only 7% of the top 250 films of 2016 were directed by women, and that number gets smaller when you look at blockbusters. Next spring, Disney will release Ava DuVernayâ€™s adaptation of â€œA Wrinkle in Time,â€ which has a budget north of $100 million. But the list of directors attached to the â€œStar Warsâ€ franchise is all-male, even with a female producer (Kathleen Kennedy) in charge. â€œIt would depend on the project,â€ Jenkins says when asked if sheâ€™d want to direct a â€œStar Warsâ€ movie.  In the Oscars race, not a single woman director has been nominated since Kathryn Bigelow became the first to win in the category in 2010. Warner Bros. is campaigning Jenkins as part of a robust Oscar push for â€œWonder Womanâ€ â€” if sheâ€™s nominated, sheâ€™ll be the first director of a comic-book movie to be recognized. â€œThereâ€™s no reason why they shouldnâ€™t be considered,â€ she says of the Academy embracing comic-book adaptations. At least thereâ€™s been some progress: This is the first time in recent memory that thereâ€™s more than one woman â€” including Dee Rees (â€œMudboundâ€) and Greta Gerwig (â€œLady Birdâ€) â€” with a real chance of being nominated for best director.  Jenkins was able to negotiate her groundbreaking deal with Warner Bros. because the studio didnâ€™t lock her down to multiple chapters. She had been in talks for â€œWonder Woman,â€ but the studio offered the job to another filmmaker. After Michelle MacLaren exited due to creative differences, Jenkins signed on, without committing to a sequel. â€œThey could have tied me up earlier,â€ she says. â€œI wouldnâ€™t have wanted that.â€ Even though she wasnâ€™t on board for a second movie, she kept envisioning it while making the first. (Sheâ€™s been working on a treatment with DC Entertainment president Geoff Johns.) â€œI think she has a really clear and fun and compelling place that sheâ€™s taking the story,â€ says Warner Bros. Pictures Group chief Toby Emmerich.  Jenkins directs a scene in the 2003 film â€œMonster.â€ Charlize Theron, who played serial killer Aileen Wuornos, won an Oscar for the lead role.  Snap Stills/REX/Shutterstock  One of the mantras associated with Wonder Woman â€” â€œLife is tough but so am Iâ€ â€” could easily apply to Jenkinsâ€™ own upbringing. Her father, William T. Jenkins, was an Air Force captain. He fought in Vietnam and later ran maneuvers out of a military base in England; his family joined him on all his adventures overseas. In interviews, Jenkins has talked a lot about how the heroism of her dad shaped â€œWonder Woman.â€ She even has a dedication to him in the filmâ€™s closing credits.  But what she doesnâ€™t talk about much is that he died, at 31, when she was only 7. â€œHe passed away after taking off from a runway exactly like the one that Steve takes off on,â€ Jenkins says, referring to Wonder Womanâ€™s boyfriend. â€œHe crashed in the ocean.â€ Sheâ€™s still not sure exactly what happened. â€œNobody knows. He was in the middle of a NATO mock dogfight. They crash a lot. Youâ€™re doing a tricky maneuver.â€  Her fatherâ€™s spirit was on the â€œWonder Womanâ€ set, even if she didnâ€™t always reference him directly. Gadot says she thought of Jenkinsâ€™ dad when she saw the film for the first time, especially during the climactic scene where Steve makes the ultimate sacrifice for the woman he loves. â€œI think that even in the short time that he was present in her life, he had a lot of effect on who she became,â€ Gadot says.  The death of her father framed Jenkinsâ€™ outlook in many ways. â€œItâ€™s part of why I think I wanted to make movies,â€ she says. â€œI wanted to experience wonder somewhere. I didnâ€™t think I would experience it in real life.â€  A few months after her dad passed away, Jenkins remembers a cross-country road trip from Kansas to San Francisco in a VW bug. â€œMy momâ€ â€” who would put herself through school to become an environmental scientist â€” â€œdropped my sister and I at the movie theater to wait out this snowstorm,â€ Jenkins says. They watched the original â€œSuperman,â€ starring Christopher Reeve. â€œI remember everything about the experience of seeing it,â€ Jenkins says. â€œIt really hit me in that way of exactly what I think superheroes were designed to do â€” to inspire you to metaphorically imagine the superhero within.â€  That movie gave a grieving young girl some hope. It also provided her with a clear goal. â€œSeriously, thatâ€™s the part I canâ€™t believe,â€ Jenkins says. â€œI always thought, because of â€˜Superman,â€™ one day I want to make a movie that makes other people feel like that movie made me feel. The fact that thatâ€™s come true is so stunning.â€  Watch a behind-the-scenes video of Jenkinsâ€™ Power of Women L.A. cover shoot."
